# The same object is passed to the function, but the variables value doesnâ€™t change even though the object is identical. This is called pass by value. 
# So what is exactly happening here? When the value is called by the function, only the value of the variable is passed, not the object itself. 
# So the variable referencing the object is not changed, but the object itself is being changed but within the function scope only. 
# Hence the change is not reflected.
